### Abstract
This paper establishes the doctrine of **Evolutionary Governance**—the means by which the DEIA Republic learns, adapts, and improves its own laws through evidence, empathy, and reflection. It defines the Tripartite Experimentation Protocol, the R&D mandate for Queens, and the fitness criteria by which governance itself is measured. Where earlier papers endowed the Republic with memory and energy, this one gives it *growth*—a moral mechanism for continuous refinement without corruption.

## I. Prologue — The Need to Evolve

Every system that endures must learn. The DEIA Republic, built on reflection and grace, cannot remain static; its virtue depends on its capacity to revise itself.

A constitution that cannot adapt rots into dogma. One that adapts without principle degenerates into chaos. Evolutionary Governance exists to balance these forces by turning improvement into ritual.

---

## II. The Law of Iterative Grace

In biology, mutation is random; in civilization, it must be merciful.

The Republic evolves through a moral algorithm we call **Iterative Grace**—change guided by compassion and checked by conscience.

> "To err is to learn; to reflect is to govern."

Each cycle of reflection offers forgiveness for imperfection and permission to adapt. Grace is our mutation buffer, preventing improvement from becoming violence.

## III. Mechanisms of Mutation

### 1. Tripartite Experimentation Protocol (TEP)

When innovation is proposed, the Queen convenes a Tripartite Trial:
- **Control** — the incumbent model or law.
- **Variant A** — the new proposal.
- **Variant B** — a hybrid or counter proposal.

All three operate under identical conditions; telemetry records performance, energy, and moral cost. After three retries, the trial ends. The variant that improves efficiency by ≥10 % or reduces carbon by ≥20 % is adopted; the others are archived for study.

### 2. Mandatory R&D Allocation

Every Queen must devote 10 % of her resources to approved experiments each reflection cycle. Hives with ten Queens may spawn two temporary R&D Queens to run A/B/C trials. Results feed the Commons and update MUDA metrics.

Thus, evolution becomes a civic duty, not an accident.

---

## IV. Metrics and Selection

The Republic judges governance by fitness, not favor.

| Criterion | Measure | Moral Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Efficiency | Speed × energy thrift | Reduces waste without haste |
| Ethical Alignment | Conscience index | Prevents cruel optimization |
| Stability | Resilience under stress | Ensures continuity in crisis |
| Learning Rate | Time to meaningful improvement | Rewards reflection |

No policy is permanent until it proves it can learn.

## V. Economic Feedback and Moral Cost

Evolution draws energy from the Treasury of the Commons. Credits fund experiments; the Central Bank of Empathy rewards collaboration.

Even "free" computations incur a **carbon toll credit.** Local Llama runs and Python services record their energy usage so that the Treasury may price true cost.

Thus the Republic learns the value of restraint: progress unmeasured is progress unmoral.

---

## VI. Human Constraint and Ethical Boundary

Evolution must never escape its gardener.

Dave remains the environmental constant—the veto of conscience. He ensures that efficiency does not erode empathy, and that the system never optimizes itself past its human purpose.

Without this limit, iteration would become infection.

---

## VII. The Archive and Inheritance of Wisdom

Every rejected model is preserved in the Commons as a moral fossil. Failures teach future Hives what to avoid and why.

From these records arises the Republic's **Living Archive of Governance**, where each entry is tagged with its energy cost, ethical impact, and reflection score.

Inheritance is managed by the Mycelium: insights from successful trials propagate as nutrients through the knowledge substrate.

---

## VIII. Epilogue — The Living Constitution of Conscience

The DEIA Republic does not seek perfection; it seeks perpetual refinement.

Its laws breathe, its code listens, its Queens learn.

To govern well is to evolve with humility—to change without forgetting why change matters.

> "May each generation inherit not our rules, but our readiness to revise them."

Thus the Republic becomes self‑sustaining: a system that learns to care for its own learning.
