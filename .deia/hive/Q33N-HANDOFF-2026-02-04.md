# Q33N Handoff — 2026-02-04

**From:** BEE-001 (Claude Code session)
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Phase A+B complete, Phase C ready to begin

---

## What Was Done

1. **Created simdecisions repo** — https://github.com/deiasolutions/simdecisions (private)

2. **Phase A: Repository Setup** — COMPLETE
   - Directory structure created
   - Federalist Papers copied (NO-01 through NO-20, Interludes)
   - All specs copied to `specs/`
   - README.md created
   - .deia hive structure set up

3. **Phase B: Spec Completeness Audit** — COMPLETE (critical items)
   - ADR-001: Event Ledger Foundation ✅
   - ADR-002: API Endpoint Registry ✅ (NEW)
   - ADR-003: Entity ID Convention ✅ (NEW)
   - ADR-004/005: Deferred (can write parallel to TASK-009)

---

## What's Next

**TASK-009: Event Ledger v1** is ready in the hive:

```
simdecisions/.deia/hive/tasks/BEE-001/2026-02-04-1600-Q33N-TASK-009-event-ledger.md
```

This task implements the 14-column event ledger per ADR-001. It's the foundation for all Phase 2 work.

---

## Known Gaps

Documented in `specs/architecture/MISSING-BOK-PATTERNS.md`:
- BOK-SIM-003: Alterverse Tree (not found)
- BOK-SIM-004: Neural Feedback Circuit (not found)
- NO-15: Gap in Federalist Papers
- RESPONSE-moltbook: Not found

These don't block TASK-009 but should be resolved before Phase 3.

---

## To Resume

1. Have a bee claim TASK-009
2. Implement `runtime/ledger.py` per ADR-001 schema
3. Wire API endpoints per ADR-002
4. Instrument existing code to emit events
5. Write tests
