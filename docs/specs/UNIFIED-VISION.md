# SimDecisions: Unified Vision

## One Sentence

**Design any system of interacting agents, run it, measure results.**

---

## The Product

**SimDecisions** — not DEIA, not RAQCOON, not Deuterium. One product.

Everything else is infrastructure inside it or philosophy behind it.

### Two Modes

1. **Production** — Real AI agents produce real outputs (code, docs, research)
2. **Simulation** — Statistical work arrivals for capacity planning, what-if analysis

### Agent Types Supported

- LLM (Claude, GPT, local Llama)
- Python scripts
- Humans (approval gates)
- Machines (controllers, PLCs, IoT) — future
- Processes (queues, workflows)
- External systems (APIs)

### Competitive Position

| Category | They Do | We Do |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Process simulators (Arena, Simio) | Model | Execute |
| AI frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI) | Execute | Measure |
| Workflow tools (n8n, Zapier) | Coordinate | Simulate |
| Org design (Figma, Miro) | Visualize | Run |

**SimDecisions does all four.**

## Core Philosophy

### "The Library Is Burning"

- 10,000 Boomers retire daily = 10,000 libraries burning
- Mirror before Guillotine — discover humans before eliminating them
- Three paths: Retain+Augment > Redeploy > Extract (never eliminate without extracting)
- Different minds need different roles (Temple Grandin cognitive diversity)
- Privacy-first discovery (voluntary, user-controlled)

### Federalist Papers (20-paper canon)

- #NOKINGS — human override always
- Protocol of Grace — pause → listen → reflect → respond → rejoin
- Ethics as infrastructure — encoded in files, not professed
- LLH (Limited Liability Hive) — bounded, observable, replaceable coordination units

---

## Current State

**Working (~70%):**
- DEIA CLI (276+ tests)
- BOK patterns (29+)
- Task file loop
- Multi-LLM support
- Flight tracking
- Session logging

**Wired (WIRE-001 complete):**
- Router (decide_route() called from task creation)
- KB injection (content injected into tasks)
- WebSocket (broadcasts task events)
- Gate enforcement (all three gates checked)

**Missing:**
- Event ledger
- DES engine
- Visual designers
- Timeline controls

## The Bootstrap Loop

SimDecisions produces code → code improves SimDecisions → self-improving system.

This is the superpower. Use the product to build the product.

---

## Key Decisions

1. **SimDecisions is THE product** — everything else is infrastructure
2. **deia_raqcoon/ is the codebase** — v1 and improv archived
3. **Local-first architecture** — cloud comes later
4. **Browser-based UI** — not Processing, not desktop
5. **General simulation** — not just workforce, any interacting agents
6. **One backlog file** — ideas don't spawn repos

---

## Success Metrics

**Feb 15:** Working loop (CLI)
**Mar 31:** DES simulation engine
**May 15:** v1.0 shipped

---

## The Really-Reallies

1. One product, not seven
2. Code is 70% done, 0% wired
3. Philosophy is complete — stop writing manifestos
4. 6-month window is real — GenX productive years finite
5. Bootstrap loop is superpower
6. 2 weeks to working, not 6
