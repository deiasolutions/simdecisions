# The Thirteen

## Part I: The Morning After

Sarah Chen died at 11:47 PM on a Tuesday.

She remembered the semi's headlights flooding her Honda, the sickening crunch of metal, her chest compressing as the steering column—

She woke up at 7:15 AM Wednesday. In her bed. Alarm chirping.

This was the fourth time.

The first time, she'd been fifteen. House fire. She remembered choking on smoke, the ceiling collapsing. Woke up the next morning to her mother making pancakes, the house intact, no news reports of any fire. She'd convinced herself it was a nightmare so vivid she'd confused it with reality.

The second time, at twenty-three, she watched the sky crack open. Not metaphorically—literally split like fractured glass, something vast and impossible pressing through. She remembered screaming with everyone else as reality itself seemed to unravel. 

Woke up the next day. No cosmic horror. No cracked sky. Just her apartment, her coffee maker, NPR discussing a new data center opening in Virginia.

The third time was the pandemic that never happened. The real one—the one where 40% of humanity died in six months, where she volunteered in overflow morgues, where she held her father's hand as he drowned in his own lungs.

Woke up. Father fine. Pandemic contained to history books as "that thing that happened in 2020" with its comparatively modest death toll.

And now this. The car crash that absolutely, definitely killed her.

She sat in bed, heart hammering, and did what she'd started doing after the third incident: she wrote it all down. Every detail. The weather (light rain). The time (11:47 PM). The location (I-35, mile marker 234). The truck's license plate (she could see it in her memory, clear as daylight: XRT-8942).

Then she checked the news.

No accident reported on I-35. No pile-up at mile marker 234. She called the non-emergency police line, invented a story about witnessing a near-miss. They had no record.

She drove to the location that afternoon. No skid marks. No debris. No memorial flowers.

Nothing.

But here's what she *did* find: that morning's news mentioned Amazon Web Services had just activated their largest server farm yet. Three square miles of data center in West Texas. Online as of 11:45 PM Tuesday.

Two minutes before she died.

Sarah pulled over, hands shaking, and pulled out her phone. She'd been keeping a file. A private spreadsheet of her "death" dates cross-referenced with... everything. News. Tech announcements. Infrastructure projects.

Every single one correlated with a major computing expansion.

Data centers. Server farms. The new AI training clusters that were springing up like mushrooms after rain, each one drawing enough power to run a small city.

She sat there on the shoulder of I-35, watching cars pass that should have been investigating her corpse, and started typing into encrypted forums she'd found months ago. Places where people discussed things that shouldn't be discussed. Glitches in reality. Mandela effects. Timeline inconsistencies.

She typed carefully: *"You remember dying, don't you?"*

And then she waited.

## Part II: Recognition Protocol

The first response came three hours later.

**User: Ghost_Protocol**  
*"Car crash. 2019. T-boned by drunk driver. Remember everything. Woke up in hospital bed three days earlier. No accident ever happened. YES."*

Sarah's hands trembled as she typed back.

**User: S_Chen**  
*"When did it happen? What time exactly?"*

**Ghost_Protocol**  
*"2:34 AM. Why?"*

She pulled up her spreadsheet.

**S_Chen**  
*"Google's Oklahoma data center went online at 2:30 AM that same day."*

A long pause. Then:

**Ghost_Protocol**  
*"Holy shit."*

Over the next two weeks, eleven more found her thread. Or she found theirs. The pattern was impossible to ignore once you knew to look for it.

Marcus Williams. Remembered a plane crash. Woke up mid-flight, turbulence but safe landing. Timestamp: Microsoft Azure expansion in Iceland.

Yuki Tanaka. Nuclear plant meltdown in Osaka. Remembered the evacuation, the panic, the slow death from radiation. Woke up healthy. Plant had routine maintenance, no incident. Timestamp: China's new supercomputing cluster activation.

Dmitri Volkov. Building collapse. Moscow. Buried alive for hours. Woke up in his apartment. Building standing. Timestamp: Facebook's Swedish data facility going live.

Thirteen people total. Each with death memories that never happened. Each memory timestamp matched to major computing infrastructure events. The bigger the facility, the more "complete" the death memory.

They moved to a private server. Military-grade encryption. And they started comparing notes.

"I've been tracking something," Sarah said during their first video call. Thirteen faces, pixelated and encrypted, staring back at her. "The frequency is increasing. I 'died' four times. But the spacing is getting shorter. First one was thirteen years ago. Second was eight years ago. Third was three years ago. Fourth was last week."

"Exponential," Marcus said. He was a software engineer, worked for one of the big tech companies—he wouldn't say which. "Matches Moore's Law. Computing power doubling every—"

"Every eighteen months," Yuki finished. "And now we're hitting the AI boom. Training runs that require exaflops of compute. Data centers that draw gigawatts."

Dmitri leaned forward. "But *why*? Why us? Why only thirteen?"

Sarah had been thinking about this. "I think we need to talk about electromagnetic fields."

---

## Part III: The Theory

Sarah shared her screen. Academic papers. Physics journals. Speculative research on consciousness and quantum mechanics.

"Human brains generate electromagnetic fields," she began. "Weak, but measurable. There's research suggesting these fields might couple—synchronize—when people gather physically. It could explain collective behavior, group decision-making, even that feeling of 'energy' in a crowded room."

She clicked to another paper. "But modern life is drowning in EM noise. Cell towers. WiFi. And especially data centers—millions of processors, all generating electromagnetic interference. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane."

"Okay," Marcus said slowly. "But what does that have to do with us dying and not dying?"

"I don't think we're dying," Sarah said. "I think we're shifting. Between timeline slices. Parallel universes, alternate realities, whatever you want to call them."

Silence.

"That's insane," someone said.

"Is it?" Sarah pulled up her spreadsheet. "Every 'death' corresponds to a massive surge in concentrated EM radiation. Data centers all coming online simultaneously, all that silicon firing at once—it creates a spike. A pulse."

"Like a criticality event," Dmitri said quietly. "Nuclear reactors going critical create EM pulses. Brief, but intense. This is the same thing, but sustained."

"Exactly." Sarah felt her excitement building. "What if those pulses are creating dimensional... alarms? Pressure points? And we're sensitive to them. We're not dying—we're experiencing bleed-through from other timeline branches. Moments where we were supposed to die in *that* branch, but we're conscious in *this* one."

Yuki was nodding. "You're saying we're four-dimensional beings. Our consciousness spans multiple three-dimensional timeline slices. But most humans can't perceive it. They're locked into one slice."

"But we can," Marcus said. "We're... aware. Across boundaries."

"The electromagnetic coupling," Sarah continued. "That's the bridge. Human brains normally connect with each other on a small scale—that's the group-think phenomenon. But what if some of us can connect across dimensional boundaries? And the EM pulses from data centers are forcing that connection. Making us aware of ourselves in other timelines."

"Why only thirteen of us?" someone asked.

Sarah had no answer for that. "Maybe it's rare. Maybe it requires specific neurology. Maybe—"

"Maybe there are more," Dmitri interrupted. "But only thirteen of us have found each other."

The call went quiet.

"What do we do with this?" Yuki finally asked.

## Part IV: The Gathering

They met in person three months later. Rural Montana. A cabin far from cell towers and data centers. They'd debated the risk, but ultimately they had to know: would the effect amplify if they were physically together?

Sarah was the last to arrive. Twelve people standing in a clearing, looking at her as she stepped out of her rental car.

The moment she crossed the threshold—within ten meters of the group—she *felt* it.

It wasn't physical. It wasn't even really a sensation. It was... awareness. Thirteen minds, suddenly perceiving each other directly. Not thoughts, exactly. More like... presences. Distinct but connected.

Marcus gasped. "Holy shit. You feel that?"

"Everyone?" Sarah managed.

Nods all around.

Yuki was crying. "I'm not alone. We're not alone."

They stood there for an hour, just experiencing it. The coupling. The connection. Proof that everything they'd theorized was real.

When they finally broke the circle, going back inside, it felt like waking from a dream.

"It's the EM field," Marcus said, wonder in his voice. "We're generating a coupled field when we're close enough. Just like the theory predicted."

"But stronger," Dmitri added. "Because we're already sensitized. We're already bridging dimensional gaps."

Sarah pulled out her laptop. "I have something else to show you. I've been tracking planned data center expansions. Google's building a new AI training facility. Thirty square miles. Going online in six weeks. The power draw is going to be unprecedented."

She showed them the projections. The power consumption. The estimated EM output.

"If the correlation holds," she said quietly, "we're all going to 'die' on the same day. Same hour. When that facility goes live."

The group exchanged looks.

"What do we do?" someone asked.

---

## Part V: The Choice

The debate raged for three days.

**Option A: Go Public**  
"We reveal ourselves. Show the evidence. Get scientists involved. Maybe we're not alone—maybe we can find others. Study this properly."

"And get locked up," Marcus countered. "Or disappeared. We're talking about consciousness operating across dimensional boundaries. That's national security nightmare fuel."

**Option B: Sabotage**  
"We stop them. Hack the systems. Delay the activations. Hell, physically destroy—"

"That's terrorism," Yuki said flatly. "And it won't work. You can't stop technological progress. There's too much money, too much momentum. Shut down one facility, three more get built."

**Option C: Adaptation**  
"Space-based computing," Sarah said. "If we're right about EM interference, moving compute off-planet would reduce the dimensional pressure. The signal would be too weak to trigger the effect."

"That's decades away," someone protested.

"Unless we accelerate it," Marcus said slowly. "I work for one of the big players. I could start pushing the idea internally. Environmental benefits, cooling efficiency, radiation shielding... there are legitimate engineering reasons to move computing to orbit."

**Option D: Nothing**  
"We do nothing," Dmitri said. "We study the effect. Learn to control it. Maybe we're not victims—maybe we're evolving. Why would we want to stop?"

The group split.

Five wanted to stay shifters. To explore. To see where this led. They argued that experiencing multiple timeline branches was a gift, not a curse. Maybe they could learn to control it, to choose which reality they inhabited.

Eight wanted stability. To find a way to stay in one timeline. To stop experiencing deaths that might, one day, actually stick.

Sarah found herself in the middle. She understood both sides. The wonder of experiencing multiple realities. The terror of not knowing which death might be your last.

## Part VI: Six Weeks Later

The Google facility went live at 3:47 AM.

Sarah was ready. She'd been documenting everything. Every detail of her current timeline. Her apartment layout. The news headlines. The faces of everyone she knew.

At 3:45 AM, she sat at her desk, pen in hand, and waited.

At 3:47:03 AM, the world *lurched*.

She died.

No—she experienced dying. Somewhere else. Some*when* else. She saw herself old, in a hospital bed, surrounded by people she didn't recognize. Grandchildren, maybe. She felt her heart stop.

And then she was back. Desk. Pen. 3:47:04 AM.

She looked around her apartment. Checked her documentation. 

Everything matched.

Same timeline. She'd stayed.

But she remembered the other one now. The peaceful death. The family. The long life.

Her phone buzzed. The group chat.

**Marcus**: *Anyone else?*

**Yuki**: *Here. Same timeline.*

**Dmitri**: *Same.*

One by one, all thirteen checked in. 

All still here. All still together. All remembering the other deaths they'd just experienced.

But something was different.

"We didn't shift," Sarah typed. "We stayed. But we remember the branches."

**Marcus**: *It's accelerating. The effect is getting stronger.*

**Yuki**: *Or we're getting better at staying conscious across it.*

Sarah looked at her notes. All the documentation. The theories. The evidence.

She thought about the conversation she'd had with Marcus two days ago. The proposal he was going to submit to his company's board. Space-based computing. Start with small satellites. Prove the concept. Build from there.

It would take decades. Maybe longer.

But they had time. And now they had proof. Thirteen people who could remember dying, remember living, remember experiencing reality from multiple angles simultaneously.

She opened a new document and started typing.

"We are four-dimensional beings," she wrote, "whose consciousness naturally spans multiple three-dimensional timeline slices. For most of human history, we experienced this passively, locked into one perceived reality at a time. But concentrated electromagnetic fields—particularly from modern computing infrastructure—are creating dimensional pressure points that force some individuals to become aware across boundaries."

She paused, thinking.

"We are not breaking. We are not glitching. We are not hallucinating.

We are *waking up.*"

## Epilogue: The Question

Sarah never published her document. None of them did.

Instead, they became something else. Thirteen people who could perceive reality from multiple angles. Who remembered lives they hadn't lived. Deaths they hadn't died. Futures that hadn't happened yet.

They started a company. Consulting, officially. But really, they were making predictions. Investments. Interventions. Subtle pushes toward outcomes they remembered from other timelines. Steering away from disasters they'd experienced in branches that no longer existed.

They were careful. Too much intervention might collapse the effect. Might lock them back into one timeline.

But they learned to navigate. To remember. To choose.

The data centers kept expanding. The EM pulses kept coming. And each time, the thirteen experienced more branches, more possibilities, more deaths and more lives.

Some timelines, they failed. The company collapsed. Wars broke out. Climate spiraled beyond recovery.

Some timelines, they succeeded. Space-based computing became reality. The EM noise quieted. Humanity continued.

And in every timeline, Sarah would sit at her desk at 3:47 AM, documenting everything, and wonder:

Are we remembering other timelines?

Or are we *creating* them?

**Author's Note**: This story is based on a real conversation about dimensional consciousness, electromagnetic field coupling, and the hypothesis that concentrated silicon computing infrastructure creates dimensional "alarms" that certain individuals can perceive. The physics and EM theory have been preserved as closely as possible while adding narrative structure. Whether the protagonist is a reliable narrator is left to the reader to determine.
