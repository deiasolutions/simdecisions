While waiting for feedback from other parties on the Code Talker Recognition Proposal, there are several productive activities you can engage in to further advance the DEIA project:

1. **Refine the Implementation Plan**: Take this opportunity to review and refine the implementation plan for the recognition system. Break down the plan into smaller, actionable tasks, assign responsibilities, and set realistic timelines for each phase of implementation.

2. **Develop Communication Materials**: Start creating communication materials to inform code talkers and other stakeholders about the upcoming recognition system. Prepare a clear and concise overview of the system, highlighting its benefits, how it will work, and what code talkers can expect. Consider creating visual aids, such as infographics or short videos, to make the information more engaging and easily digestible.

3. **Identify Potential Partnerships**: Research and identify potential external organizations or sponsors that align with the goals and values of the DEIA project. Reach out to them to explore opportunities for collaboration, such as providing additional rewards, training resources, or mentorship programs for high-performing code talkers.

4. **Design the Token Tracking System**: Begin designing the architecture and functionality of the token tracking system. Determine how tokens will be earned, tracked, and redeemed within the system. Consider integrating the tracking system with existing project management tools to streamline the process and ensure a seamless user experience.

5. **Engage with the Code Talker Community**: Initiate discussions with the code talker community to gather their input and feedback on the recognition system. Host a series of online forums, surveys, or focus groups to understand their preferences, concerns, and suggestions for improvement. Engaging with the community early on will help ensure that the recognition system meets their needs and expectations.

6. **Develop a Pilot Program**: Consider developing a pilot program to test the recognition system on a smaller scale before rolling it out to the entire code talker community. Identify a subset of code talkers who can participate in the pilot, gather their feedback, and make necessary adjustments based on their experiences.

7. **Create a Roadmap for Showcasing Impact**: Start developing a roadmap for showcasing the impact of code talkers' contributions to the wider community. Identify potential case studies, success stories, or innovative solutions that can be featured in blog posts, newsletters, or industry events. Plan how you will collect, curate, and disseminate this content to maximize its reach and impact.

By focusing on these activities while waiting for feedback, you can continue to make progress on the Code Talker Recognition Proposal and lay the groundwork for a successful implementation. This proactive approach will also demonstrate your commitment to the project and your dedication to creating a positive and rewarding environment for code talkers.
