# Routing Question: Missing Submission Files

## Issue
Cannot locate submission files referenced in `deia_hive_submission_bundle.md`.

## Expected Files (from bundle index)
The bundle references a `submission_docs/` directory containing:
1. `hive_natural_laws_v0.2.md`
2. `fibonacci_growth_protocol.md`
3. `meta_genetic_inheritance_and_troop_mesh_protocol.md`
4. `hive_environment_protocol.md`
5. `comms_hub_requirements.md`
6. `hive_clone_and_split_guidelines.md`
7. `deia_bundle_manifest.md`

## Actual State
- **Location checked**: `C:\Users\davee\Downloads\submission_docs\`
- **Result**: Directory does not exist
- **Alternative check**: Searched `C:\Users\davee\Downloads\` directly
- **Found**: Only `deia_hive_submission_bundle.md` (the index file)

## Diagnostic
The bundle index file exists, but none of the referenced submission documents are present in:
- `C:\Users\davee\Downloads\submission_docs/` (expected location)
- `C:\Users\davee\Downloads\` (alternative location)

## Possible Causes
1. Files not yet downloaded/created
2. Files in different location
3. Bundle is a template/placeholder
4. Files need to be extracted from bundle (embedded?)

## Recommendation
Please verify:
- Are the submission files in a different location?
- Should they be created/downloaded separately?
- Is the bundle complete or awaiting additional files?

## Files Found in Downloads
Potentially related markdown files found:
- `deia_protocols_and_products_catalog_v_1.md`
- `fibonacci_workweek_manifesto.md` (possibly related to fibonacci_growth_protocol?)
- `deia-orchestration-md.md`
- Various survey spec files

## Next Steps
Awaiting clarification before proceeding with file moves. No files have been moved to avoid incorrect routing.
