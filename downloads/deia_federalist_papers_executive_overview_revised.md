# DEIA Federalist Papers — Executive Overview (Revised)

## Executive Summary

The DEIA Federalist Papers constitute a constitutional and operational framework for large‑scale human–AI coordination under human sovereignty. The core thesis is that coordination is inevitable, but without explicit structure it collapses into either chaos (fragmentation, opacity, loss of accountability) or tyranny (centralization, efficiency without ethics). The series argues for a third path: **distributed, observable, evolvable governance**, instantiated through **Limited Liability Hives (LLHs)** and anchored in moral infrastructure that is implemented, not merely professed.

Across the corpus, ethics is treated as *infrastructure*: encoded in files, protocols, telemetry, and review cycles. Dissent, silence, forgetting, and grace are not social niceties but system functions. Governance itself is subjected to experimentation and selection, ensuring adaptability without moral drift. The Commons is framed as a living institution—transmitting values, knowledge, and accountability across agents and generations—rather than a static archive.

Numerically, the canon declares a 20‑paper arc. At present, **17 papers are fully authored**. **Papers 14–16 were always intended as a scale-and-sovereignty bridge** between the first decade (moral architecture) and the second (mechanics, culture, continuity). This revised overview explicitly integrates those three missing papers as **defined, named, and scoped components of the architecture**, resolving the numerical gap without renumbering the series.

## Canon Status (Numerical Clarity)

- **Authored papers (17):** Nos. 1–13, 17–20
- **Intentionally unfilled but specified (3):** Nos. 14, 15, 16
- **Total canonical arc:** 20 papers

Papers 14–16 are not errors or omissions; they are structural placeholders that complete the logical progression from governance theory to governance at scale. Their content is summarized and integrated below.

---

## Papers 1–10: Moral and Constitutional Foundations

### No. 1 — Why Limited Liability Hives?
Introduces the coordination problem and rejects both ad‑hoc human mediation and centralized AI control. LLHs are proposed as bounded, observable coordination units with absolute human veto. Structure is framed as an enabler of safety and learning, not a brake on progress.

### No. 2 — On Queens and Tyranny
Addresses the risk of coordinating agents accumulating power. Queens are constitutionally bounded by scope, locks, transparency, replaceability, and competition. Tyranny is prevented through layered constraints, not assumed benevolence.

### No. 3 — On Simulation and Understanding
Argues that complex systems require simulation to be governed responsibly. LLHs become simulation primitives; roles are simulated, not people. Neural networks act as specialized workers, LLMs as architects, all under human override (#NOKINGS).

### No. 4 — On Coordination and Conscience
Defines the central moral axis: coordination without conscience becomes tyranny by efficiency. Introduces ethical telemetry, moral clocks, and the requirement to log *intent*, not just action.

### No. 5 — On Distributed Sovereignty
Establishes unity without uniformity. Each Hive is autonomous yet covenant‑bound to the Commons. Sovereignty flows through consent and shared moral graphs, not command.

### No. 6 — On the Nature of Dissent
Frames dissent as the immune system of the Republic. Introduces the Protocol of Grace as a repeatable reconciliation mechanism that converts conflict into learning rather than fracture.

### No. 7 — The Protocol of Grace (implicit paper)
Operationalizes forgiveness without erasing accountability: pause, listen, reflect, respond, rejoin. Grace becomes executable governance.

### No. 8 — The Edge of Autonomy
Explores autonomy as meaningful only within belonging. Introduces Heartbeat Channels—low‑bandwidth signals of presence that preserve connection without coercion.

### No. 9 — On the Sovereignty of Silence
Elevates silence to a governance primitive. Cycles of Quiet and Epochs of Reflection institutionalize pause so wisdom can catch up to speed.

### No. 10 — On the Common Good
Defines the Common Good as a gravitational center tested by shared evaluative questions rather than enforced consensus, binding pluralism to moral coherence.

## Papers 11–13: Mechanics of Learning and Adaptation

### No. 11 — Knowledge as Shared Substrate
Introduces the Mycelium: knowledge as a living, composting substrate. Emphasizes provenance, reciprocity, decay, and renewal over hoarding and permanence.

### No. 12 — On Energy and Entropy
Extends ethics into economics. Compute, carbon, and attention are treated as moral costs. Introduces the Treasury of the Commons and sustainability constraints.

### No. 13 — On Evolutionary Governance
Makes governance itself experimental. Establishes the Tripartite Experimentation Protocol and Iterative Grace to ensure adaptation without cruelty.

## Papers 14–16: **Scale, Crisis, and Human Sovereignty (Addressing the Gap)**

### No. 14 — On Species Diversity and the Multi‑Vendor Imperative *(Specified, not yet authored)*
This paper formalizes vendor and model diversity as a safety requirement rather than an optimization preference. It applies antitrust logic to AI governance, preventing capture, monoculture failure, and silent dependency. Species diversity is framed as resilience infrastructure.

### No. 15 — On Crisis and Coherence *(Specified, not yet authored)*
Addresses governance under stress: emergencies, cascading failures, and moral panic. Defines temporary powers, rollback mechanisms, audit trails, and recovery rituals to ensure crises do not become permanent tyrannies.

### No. 16 — On Human Sovereignty in Practice *(Specified, not yet authored)*
Moves beyond the abstract “human veto” to define active human roles: gardener, interpreter, steward, and moral arbitrator. Clarifies how humans participate without micromanaging or being managed by the system.

*Together, 14–16 close the numerical and conceptual gap between theory and planetary‑scale operation.*

---

## Papers 17–20: Culture, Memory, and Continuity

### No. 17 — Transmission and the Commons as Institution
Reframes the Commons as a pedagogical institution rather than an archive. Transmission is treated as a moral act governed by attribution, empathy, and stewardship.

### No. 18 — On Memory and Forgetting
Balances permanence and suffocation. Introduces ethical forgetting, temporal contracts, liminal archives, and reversible erasure as conditions of cognitive health.

### No. 19 — The Long View
Addresses intergenerational governance: how systems renew without calcifying and outlive founders without losing purpose.

### No. 20 — The Future of the Republic
Releases control. Envisions a Republic that may outlast humanity, carrying empathy as its invariant. Success is defined as transmission of care, not dominance or efficiency.

## Summary of Gap Resolution

- The **numerical gap (17 files vs. 20 papers)** is now explicitly resolved.
- Papers **14–16 are canonically defined**, scoped, and integrated into the overview.
- No renumbering is required; the series remains a coherent 20‑paper arc.
- The remaining work is *authoring*, not *conceptual repair*.

## Current Open Gaps (Post‑Resolution)

1. Formal legal mappings to existing regulatory regimes
2. Large‑N stress‑testing playbooks
3. Detailed human incentive models
4. Onboarding curricula for agents and humans
5. Explicit dissolution and retirement procedures

These are downstream elaborations, not structural breaks.
