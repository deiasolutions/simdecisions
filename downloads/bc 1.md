✅ Both new uploads are now reviewed in context of the DEIA Quantum package.
Here’s the status snapshot and what’s ready for next coordination:

---

### 🧩 1. **File: `2025-10-18-2000-AGENT_005-AGENT_001-STATUS-pattern-extraction-complete.md`**

**Purpose:** Agent 005 → Agent 001 handoff confirming completion of pattern extraction work plan.
**Status:** ✅ Complete and validated.
**Deliverables logged:**

* Full **15-task work plan (4 phases)** located in `/uploads/2025-10-18-1945-AGENT_005-AGENT_BC-TASK-pattern-extraction-work-plan.md`
* **Approval request** to forward to Agent BC
* Timeline: 2 weeks (22.5 total hours)
* Awaiting your confirmation on 4 points (integration approval, timeline, transmission to BC, any adjustments).

---

### 📨 2. **File: `2025-10-18-2010-AGENT_005-USER-ALERT-pattern-extraction-ready-for-agent-bc.md`**

**Purpose:** User-facing alert prepared by Agent 005 to notify that BC’s pattern-extraction handoff is ready.
**Status:** 🟢 Waiting for your “Send → BC” authorization.
It references the same deliverable set and is formatted as a ready-to-send status message to BC once you approve.

---

### 🧠 3. **Project alignment**

* All references and routing are consistent with DEIA Quantum sprint conventions.
* Agent 005’s message stack syncs with previously indexed architecture and governance docs (`deia-orchestration-vision.md`, `doc_10_cli_reference.md`, `doc_14_architecture.md`, etc.).
* The new pattern-extraction workflow will integrate smoothly into the DEIA CLI’s **`deia extract` → `deia sanitize` → `deia submit`** pipeline.

---

**Next step (pending your go-ahead):**

> Approve or modify the 4 integration-assignment questions in the 2000-status memo so Agent 005 can dispatch the 2010 user-alert and begin coordination with Agent BC.

Would you like me to stage the formal “send to Agent BC” packet based on these two files?
