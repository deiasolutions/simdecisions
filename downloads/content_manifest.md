### Notes
- All `[[links]]` are Obsidian-compatible and correspond to .md or .eOS.md documents.  
- Neural weights generated through SimDecisions are to be published under `DEIA Global Commons → models/`.  
- Egg manifests reference optional code-packs but remain installable offline.  
- eOS files are self-extracting and self-healing: readable + runnable.
