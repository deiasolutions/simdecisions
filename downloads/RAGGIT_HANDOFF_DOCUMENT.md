## INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CHAT

Copy/paste this into a NEW chat in this same project:

---

**READ ALL PAST CHATS IN THIS PROJECT FIRST.** Use conversation_search and recent_chats tools to gather everything documented so far.

I'm in the early stages of building RAGGIT - what I've been calling a "Global Bazaar for the Third Millennium." Right now, all we have is the vision and strategy scattered across conversations in this project. 

**Where we are:**
- Vision and business model defined in past chats
- Domains and social handles decided
- Core positioning articulated
- NO code written yet
- NO detailed specs exist yet

**What I need from you:**
Create a comprehensive handoff document for Claude Code to expand into full design specifications and architecture documents BEFORE any coding begins.

**Your approach:**
1. Read through all past conversations thoroughly
2. Extract my vision, business model, positioning, and future ideas
3. Think about what Claude Code needs to understand to help me flesh out this vision into detailed specs
4. Create a handoff document that gives Claude Code enough context to ask smart questions and propose architecture, designs, and implementation strategies

**The goal:** Claude Code should understand my ideas for the future well enough to help me BUILD those ideas into concrete specifications, wireframes, database schemas, architecture diagrams, and technical documentation.

**Output:** Single comprehensive markdown file for the GitHub repo.

**Remember:** This is pre-code. We're in the "figuring it all out" phase. I need Claude Code to help me think through and document the vision, not just execute predefined requirements
