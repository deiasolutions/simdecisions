# SimDecisions: Unified Vision

**A Product of DEIA Solutions**

## One Sentence

**Design any system of interacting agents, run it, measure results.**

---

## The Company

**DEIA Solutions** — Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Automation

We build tools that help organizations understand and optimize how humans and AI work together. Our thesis: the workforce transformation isn't about replacing humans—it's about discovering what they know before they leave, and building systems that honor both human expertise and machine capability.

**Domains:** simdecisions.com, deiasolutions.com

## The Product

**SimDecisions** is the flagship product. Everything else is infrastructure inside it or philosophy behind it.

### Two Modes

1. **Production** — Real AI agents produce real outputs (code, docs, research)
2. **Simulation** — Statistical work arrivals for capacity planning, what-if analysis

### Agent Types Supported

- LLM (Claude, GPT, local Llama)
- Python scripts
- Humans (approval gates)
- Machines (controllers, PLCs, IoT) — future
- Processes (queues, workflows)
- External systems (APIs)

### Competitive Position

| Category | They Do | We Do |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Process simulators (Arena, Simio) | Model | Execute |
| AI frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI) | Execute | Measure |
| Workflow tools (n8n, Zapier) | Coordinate | Simulate |
| Org design (Figma, Miro) | Visualize | Run |

**SimDecisions does all four: Model → Execute → Measure → Simulate.**

## Core Philosophy

### "The Library Is Burning"

- 10,000 Boomers retire daily = 10,000 libraries burning
- Mirror before Guillotine — discover humans before eliminating them
- Three paths: **Retain+Augment > Redeploy > Extract** (never eliminate without extracting)
- Different minds need different roles (Temple Grandin cognitive diversity)
- Privacy-first discovery (voluntary, user-controlled)

### The 96% Movement

- "We are the 96%" — creators vs. extractive platforms
- No Billionaires Clause — individual wealth capped at $999M
- Creator-majority governance
- Fork rights if governance fails

### Federalist Papers (20-paper canon)

| Paper | Theme |
|-------|-------|
| No. 2 | Queens and Tyranny — preventing AI power concentration |
| No. 3 | Simulation and Understanding — why we must model |
| No. 4 | Coordination and Conscience — sync without souls |
| No. 5 | Distributed Sovereignty — many centers, one purpose |
| No. 6 | Nature of Dissent — disagreement as immune system |
| No. 7 | Protocol of Grace — pause → listen → reflect → respond → rejoin |
| No. 8 | Edge of Autonomy — freedom with belonging |
| No. 10 | Common Good — the gravity that binds |
| No. 12 | Energy and Entropy — moral economics |
| No. 13 | Evolutionary Governance — systems that improve themselves |
| No. 14 | Species Diversity — multi-vendor imperative |
| No. 16 | Human Sovereignty — humans remain in charge |
| No. 17 | Transmission and Commons — how knowledge persists |
| No. 19 | The Long View — planning beyond our lifetimes |
| No. 20 | Future of the Republic — what comes after us |

**Key principles:**
- #NOKINGS — human override always
- Ethics as infrastructure — encoded in files, not professed
- LLH (Limited Liability Hive) — bounded, observable, replaceable coordination units

- Gate enforcement (all three gates checked)

### Phase 2 In Progress (METRICS-001)
- TASK-009: Event ledger — PENDING
- TASK-010: Cost tracking — PENDING
- TASK-011: Dashboard v1 — PENDING
- TASK-012: Export formats — PENDING

### Missing (Future Phases)
- DES simulation engine (Phase 3)
- Visual designers (Phase 4)
- Timeline controls (Phase 4)
- Packaging & ship (Phase 5)

## The Bootstrap Loop

SimDecisions produces code → code improves SimDecisions → self-improving system.

This is the superpower. Use the product to build the product.

---

## Key Decisions

1. **SimDecisions is THE product** — everything else is infrastructure
2. **deia_raqcoon/ is the codebase** — v1 and improv archived
3. **Local-first architecture** — cloud comes later
4. **Browser-based UI** — not Processing, not desktop
5. **General simulation** — not just workforce, any interacting agents
6. **One backlog file** — ideas don't spawn repos

---

## Success Metrics

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Working loop (CLI) | Feb 15, 2026 | ✓ Complete |
| Metrics & observability | Apr 11, 2026 | In Progress |
| DES simulation engine | May 23, 2026 | Planned |
| Visual layer | Jul 4, 2026 | Planned |
| v1.0 shipped | Aug 1, 2026 | Planned |

---

## The Really-Reallies

1. One product, not seven
2. Philosophy is complete — stop writing manifestos
3. 6-month window is real — GenX productive years finite
4. Bootstrap loop is superpower
5. Ship first, expand later

---

# Addendum A: RAGGIT Specification

**The Global Bazaar for the Third Millennium**

**Version:** 0.2.0-draft

## Vision

RAGGIT is an open creator marketplace where anyone can publish, version, license, and monetize structured knowledge collections. It combines GitHub's version control, Patreon's creator monetization, and TikTok's social discovery—for all creatable content types.

**Core thesis:** The 96% create the value. The current system extracts it. RAGGIT reverses the flow.

## What is a Ragg?

A **ragg** (or **ra96**) is the atomic unit of RAGGIT: a versioned, licensed, attributed knowledge collection.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Content** | RAG collections, prompts, datasets, templates, media, any structured knowledge |
| **Metadata** | Creator attribution, version history, provenance chain |
| **Commerce** | License tier, pricing, access controls |
| **Transport** | ClipEgg-compatible reference for lightweight sharing |

## Commerce Actions

Six verbs define all marketplace interactions:

| Action | Payment | Access Level | Duration |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **share** | free | reference only | permanent link |
| **show** | free | reference only | link expires |
| **borrow** | free | full content | access expires |
| **rent** | paid | full content | access expires |
| **subscribe** | paid | full content | renews on date |
| **purchase** | paid | full content | permanent |

### Monetization Ladder

```
share → show → borrow → rent → subscribe → purchase
  │       │       │        │        │          │
  └── free discovery ──────┴── paid conversion ─┘
```

## Architecture

### Layer Separation

| Layer | Protocol | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Transport** | ClipEgg | How eggs move between apps (copy, cut) |
| **Commerce** | RAGGIT | What raggs mean in a marketplace |
| **Trust** | Provenance | Who created what, when, with what sources |

### Provenance Chain

Every ragg carries cryptographic provenance:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `creator_id` | Verified creator identity |
| `created_at` | Timestamp of original creation |
| `version_history` | Chain of all modifications |
| `source_attribution` | References to upstream content |
| `signature` | C2PA-compatible content authenticity |

## Governance

### The 96% Principle

- **No Billionaires Clause** — Individual wealth from RAGGIT capped at $999M
- **Creator-majority governance** — Platform decisions require creator consent
- **Transparent economics** — All fee structures publicly documented
- **Fork rights** — If governance fails, community can fork the protocol

## MVP Scope

Launch with four verbs:

| Verb | Why |
|------|-----|
| **share** | Core virality — free reference sharing |
| **borrow** | Conversion funnel — free trial of full content |
| **rent** | Low-commitment revenue — paid temporary access |
| **purchase** | High-commitment revenue — paid permanent access |

---

# Addendum B: ClipEgg Transport Protocol

**Reference-First Data Movement**

## Core Concept

ClipEgg replaces payload-based copy/paste with lightweight references. Instead of copying full content, you copy a reference that resolves on demand.

## Egg Structure

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `uri` | Where the content lives |
| `label` | Human-readable name |
| `type` | MIME type or content category |
| `content` | Minimal preview (optional) |
| `caps` | Capabilities/permissions |
| `action` | copy or cut |

## Hatch Protocol

When a reference is "hatched" (resolved):
1. App requests full content from `uri`
2. Access rights verified
3. Content delivered or error returned
4. For RAGGIT: commerce hooks fire at hatch time

## Why Reference-First?

- Minimal payload through clipboard/network
- Full content resolves only when needed
- Access rights enforced at resolution time
- Creator retains control until resolution
