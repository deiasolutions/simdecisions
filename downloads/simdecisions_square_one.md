# SimDecisions: Idea Collection (Square One)

**Started:** 2026-02-01
**Purpose:** Capture everything Dave has wanted to build, from all sources

---

## How to Use This Document

1. Paste the extraction prompt into each Claude.ai project
2. Copy the extracted ideas here
3. Once all sources are collected, we synthesize into a real spec

## Sources to Mine

### Claude.ai Projects
- [ ] Project 1: _______________
- [ ] Project 2: _______________
- [ ] Project 3: _______________
- [ ] (add more as needed)

### Code Repos (for idea archaeology only)
- [ ] deiasolutions/deia — what was I trying to build?
- [ ] DAAAAVE-ATX/simulation — what did old simulation work suggest?
- [ ] Specs and docs in those repos

### Other Sources
- [ ] Notes, docs, sketches
- [ ] Conversations with others
- [ ] Things in your head not written anywhere

## Synthesis (fill in after collection)

### The Core Problem
(What are we actually solving?)

### The Core Solution
(What does the product actually do?)

### Who It's For
(Who uses it and why?)

### What Makes It Different
(Why this vs alternatives?)

### The MVP
(Smallest thing that proves the idea works)

### The Full Vision
(Where does this go in 3-5 years?)

## Next Steps
1. Run extraction prompt in all Claude.ai projects
2. Review code repos for idea archaeology
3. Brain dump anything not captured elsewhere
4. Synthesize into unified spec
5. Define MVP scope
6. Start building
