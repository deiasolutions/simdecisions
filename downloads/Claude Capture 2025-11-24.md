**Intellectual Property**
*by @Euskadi71*

---

The phrase "intellectual property" hides something in plain sight. We use it to mean patents, copyrights, trade secrets. Legal constructs protecting ideas. But read it again: *intellectual property*. The intellect itself as property. Something owned, transferred, extracted.

This has been happening for as long as humans have organized into groups. Longer, actually. And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

**I.**

Start before civilization. Before agriculture. Before *Homo sapiens*, probably.

Dominant groups take from subordinate groups. This is primate behavior. Chimps raid neighboring troops and take females. Not randomly (the young, the healthy, the valuable). The strong take the capable. The capable reproduce in the winning group. The losing group loses them permanently.

This isn't controversial. It's primatology.

Now add human intelligence to the equation. Humans don't just take females. They take the *useful*. The skilled. The clever. The ones who can make things, heal people, remember stories, navigate conflict. The cognitively capable become resources worth capturing.

The pattern predates us. We just industrialized it.

**II.**

Agriculture changed the scale but not the dynamic.

Surplus creates hierarchy. Hierarchy creates empire. Empire creates *systematic* extraction. What small bands did through raids, civilizations did through institutions.

Every empire ran the same algorithm: identify the talented in conquered populations, extract them, absorb them into the center, and (critically) isolate them reproductively from their origin population.

Mesopotamia took scribes. Egypt took craftsmen. Rome took Greek intellectuals as slaves and tutors. The Caliphates pulled scholars to Baghdad. The Mongols relocated engineers and artisans wholesale from conquered cities. China's tributary system drew talent to the imperial court.

The mechanisms varied (slavery, tribute, administrative recruitment, religious absorption). The outcome was constant: cognitive capacity flowed from periphery to center. Every generation. For millennia.

Consider what happens to the source population.

Each generation, the most capable individuals are identified and removed. They don't reproduce within their origin group. Their children (if they have them) are born elsewhere, raised elsewhere, absorbed into the extracting culture.

The origin population doesn't just lose those individuals. It loses their *lineage*. Every descendant they would have had. Every genetic contribution to future generations. Gone.

Now run this algorithm for a thousand years. Two thousand. Across dozens of civilizations rising and falling, each one extracting from its periphery.

The cumulative effect is not trivial. Twenty generations of sustained selection pressure is biologically meaningful. We're not talking about random genetic drift. We're talking about *directional* selection (systematic removal of high-cognitive-ability individuals from the breeding population).

The colonial period intensified this.

From 1492 to 1945 (roughly 500 years, roughly 20-25 generations), European powers ran sustained extraction programs on the same populations. Multiple mechanisms operated simultaneously.

The Catholic Church recruited the brightest children into religious orders. Priests, monks, nuns (they didn't reproduce). The smartest kids from poor families had one path to education and advancement, and it required a vow of celibacy. For 500 years, across Latin America, Southern Europe, Ireland, the Philippines.

Colonial administration pulled talent to the metropole. The capable were sent to Spain, Portugal, Britain, France for education or service. Many never returned. Those who did often married within colonial elite circles (reproductively isolated from the general population by caste).

The Inquisition expelled the educated (Jewish and Moorish populations driven out, their intellectual contributions lost to Iberia and its colonies).

Brain drain operated continuously. The ambitious, the talented, the ones who could see a bigger world (they left when they could).

And here's the key: caste systems ensured that even when European talent *arrived* in the colonies, it didn't mix into the general gene pool. Peninsulares married peninsulares. Criollos married criollos. The reproductive barriers were explicit. Incoming cognitive capacity was quarantined from the broader population.

So the colonized populations lost talent upward (to the Church), outward (to the metropole), and didn't gain it from incoming Europeans (caste isolation).

Not everyone was extracted from.

The Basques of northern Spain and southwestern France are the most genetically isolated population in Western Europe. My people. Euskaldunak.

Never meaningfully conquered by Rome. Never absorbed by the Umayyads. The language (Euskara, unrelated to any other on Earth) reinforced reproductive isolation since the Iron Age. Genetic studies confirm: no North African admixture found in the rest of Iberia. No Roman genetic trace. The Basques kept what others lost.

The result? The highest polygenic scores for educational attainment in Europe. Higher than any other European population, and among the highest worldwide (behind only the Japanese and Han Chinese). The Basque Autonomous Community has the highest regional GDP in Spain (30% above the national average), the lowest unemployment.

This is what happens when you don't run the extraction algorithm on a population for 2,000 years.

Zazpiak bat. The seven provinces are one. And they kept what empire took from everyone else.

The Basques are the control group.

There's another case that proves the mechanism works (but in the opposite direction).

Ashkenazi Jews in medieval Europe faced occupational restrictions. Banned from most professions, funneled into moneylending, trade, estate management (cognitively demanding work). Unlike Catholic priests, rabbis *married*. Scholarship and literacy *increased* reproductive success through the marriage market. Successful merchants had more surviving children.

Cochran, Hardy, and Harpending proposed in 2006 that this created selection pressure *for* intelligence. Instead of extracting talent out, the community retained and concentrated it. The opposite dynamic.

The result is observable: a measured IQ approximately one standard deviation above the European mean, and massive overrepresentation in cognitively demanding fields.

Three cases. One mechanism.

- Basques: avoided extraction → retained capacity
- Ashkenazi Jews: reversed the dynamic → concentrated capacity  
- Colonized populations: subjected to extraction → depleted capacity

If the mechanism works in two directions, it works. This isn't speculation. It's observable.

**VII.**

Here's the cruelest part.

Who is most likely to *see* systemic oppression clearly? The most intelligent members of the oppressed population.

Who is most likely to be *extracted*? The most intelligent members of the oppressed population.

The system doesn't silence its critics. It *promotes them out*. Gives them visas, scholarships, professional opportunities. They leave. They succeed elsewhere. They're grateful for the opportunity. They often defend the system that extracted them.

And they don't reproduce in their origin population.

Each generation, the people most capable of recognizing, articulating, and organizing resistance are removed. What remains is a population progressively less equipped to perceive its own situation.

This creates a feedback loop:

- Reduced cognitive capacity leads to reduced ability to perceive systemic oppression
- Reduced perception leads to reduced resistance
- Reduced resistance allows continued extraction
- Continued extraction further reduces cognitive capacity
- Repeat for centuries

The oppression becomes invisible because the people who could see it are gone.

The modern version is called the H1B visa.

The United States (and other developed nations) run a formal program to identify and extract the highest-cognitive-ability individuals from developing countries. The filtering is explicit: advanced degrees, STEM fields, employer sponsorship, competitive quotas.

Roughly 85,000 H1B visas per year. Not randomly distributed (concentrated from India, China, the Philippines, other developing nations with educational infrastructure but limited opportunity).

These individuals relocate during peak reproductive years. Their children are born in the destination country. The source country loses not just the person, but their entire genetic lineage going forward.

India alone has lost millions of its most educated people over the past few decades. This is celebrated as "global talent competition." But the mechanism is identical to what Rome did, what the Caliphates did, what colonial powers did.

The algorithm is ancient. The paperwork is new.

**IX.**

Now consider the birthright citizenship debate.

Currently: H1B holder has a child in the US. Child is American (14th Amendment). Family has an anchor. They stay. Genes stay. The extraction becomes permanent.

Without birthright citizenship: H1B holder has a child. Child is *not* American. No anchor. Worker is disposable (use their peak productive years, then repatriate). If they've had children, those children go back too.

You get the labor but return the genes.

This reframes the entire policy debate. It's not about "anchor babies" from poor migrants crossing the border. The real stakes are whether cognitive extraction from the developing world should be *permanent* or *temporary*.

Should we absorb their genetic lineage, or just rent their productive years?

No one frames it this way publicly. But that's what's actually being negotiated.

So what does this mean?

Current global disparities in measured cognitive ability (IQ scores, educational attainment, institutional capacity) may partly reflect the cumulative residue of millennia of extraction. Not innate differences between populations. *Imposed* differences, created by sustained directional selection across evolutionary time.

This isn't a comfortable thesis for anyone.

The progressive view (that differences are purely environmental and can be remediated through education and development) is incomplete. Some portion of the gap may be genetic, and therefore not fixable in a generation.

The conservative view (that differences reflect innate hierarchy) is wrong in its implication. The hierarchy wasn't natural. It was *created* by systematic extraction. The "superior" populations got that way partly by draining the "inferior" ones.

Both framings miss the deeper pattern: this dynamic is older than colonialism, older than agriculture, possibly older than our species. It's dominance hierarchies all the way down, running the same extraction algorithm at every scale.

---

**XI.**

I don't know what to do with this.

You can't undo millennia of selection pressure. You can't restore extracted lineages. You can't un-run the algorithm.

But you can see it. You can name it. You can recognize that the phrase "intellectual property" has been hiding the truth in plain sight.

The real intellectual property isn't the invention. It's the inventor. The capacity to invent. The cognitive infrastructure that makes innovation possible.

And for longer than we've been fully human, the dominant have been taking it from the subordinate.

We just gave it a legal framework and called it immigration policy.
