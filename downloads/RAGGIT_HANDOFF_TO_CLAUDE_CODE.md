# RAGGIT: HANDOFF DOCUMENT FOR CLAUDE CODE
## Pre-Development Strategic Context & Vision Document

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**RAGGIT** is envisioned as the "Global Bazaar for the Third Millennium" - a social platform where creators can version, monetize, and share knowledge collections (RAGs) with the world. Think GitHub + Patreon + TikTok for ANY creatable content.

**Current Status:** Pre-code. Vision and strategy defined. No specifications exist yet.

**Your Mission:** Help expand this vision into detailed specifications, architecture, wireframes, and technical documentation BEFORE any coding begins.

---

## THE VISION: WHAT RAGGIT WANTS TO BECOME

### The Big Picture
RAGGIT aims to be a **$100 billion IPO in 3 years** - not just a product, but a movement.

### The Core Concept
A social platform where people create, version, license, and monetize "RAGs" (knowledge collections). These could be:
- Research papers and literature reviews (academics)
- Sample packs and mixing configurations (DJs/musicians)
- Design systems and asset libraries (designers)
- Prompt collections and AI workflows (developers)
- Course materials and teaching resources (educators)
- Legal research and case law collections (lawyers)
- **Anything that can be versioned and shared as knowledge**

### The Platform Positioning
**RAGGIT = GitHub + Patreon + TikTok + RAG**

1.1. **GitHub** - Version control for knowledge, forking, collaboration
1.2. **Patreon** - Creator monetization, subscription tiers, direct support
1.3. **TikTok** - Social discovery feed, algorithmic recommendations, trending content
1.4. **RAG** - Intelligent search and retrieval across all knowledge

---

## THE MOVEMENT: "WE ARE THE 96%"

### The Philosophy
RAGGIT isn't just a platform - it's a wealth redistribution movement.

### The Numbers
- Top 4% = the privileged elite
- 96% = everyone else
- Message: "Knowledge for the 96%, built by the 96%"

### The Revolutionary Corporate Structure

**No Billionaires Clause**
- Maximum individual wealth cap: $999 million (inflation-adjusted to 1996 dollars)
- Upon reaching the cap, individuals must:
  - Donate excess to 96% Foundation, OR
  - Transfer equity to employee ownership, OR
  - Leave the company with honors
- Built into all employment contracts and equity agreements
- Enforced through annual wealth audits

**Why This Matters**
- First company with built-in wealth cap
- Proves "We are the 96%" isn't just marketing
- Forces sustainable wealth redistribution
- Keeps leadership connected to regular people

### Target Personal Wealth Philosophy
- Sweet spot: $10M-50M (wealthy but not rich)
- Enough for financial freedom and generational security
- Not enough to become disconnected from the 96%
- Allows significant impact without corruption

---

## BRANDING & IDENTITY

### Current Assets
**Domains:**
- ra96it.com (primary)
- ra96it.app (secondary)

**Social Handles:**
- @ra96it (consistent across platforms)

**GitHub:**
- Repository created: ra96-url-shortener (needs renaming to RAGGIT)

### The "96" Brand System

**Logo Concept: Minimalist "96"**
- Just the numbers (like Nike swoosh - instantly recognizable)
- Based on dodecagon geometry (12 sides, each interior angle = 96°)
- Sacred geometry significance:
  - 12 = divine order, completion (zodiac, months, hours, apostles)
  - 96 in numerology = service, harmony, humanitarian focus
  - Chinese culture = "long-lasting," prosperity
  - 96 ÷ 12 = 8 (infinity symbol)

**The Verb: "96 it"**
- "Did you 96 that research?"
- "I'm gonna 96 my playlist"
- "Let's 96 this conversation"
- "96 your knowledge, share the world"

**Exponent Branding System: "Product⁹⁶"**
- Similar to (PRODUCT)RED
- Example: "Britney Spears⁹⁶" (if she shares content on platform)
- Shows brand partnerships with 96 as exponential power
- Reinforces the mathematics and movement

**"RAG" as Core Verb**
- People create "RAGs" (knowledge collections they can sell)
- "RAG" maintained in all naming and social presence
- RAG = Retrieve, Augment, Generate (technical)
- RAG = Riches, Assets, Goods (creator economy)
- RAG = multiple meanings, globally recognized

### Visual Identity (To Be Developed)
- Primary logo: "96" in clean typography
- Animated logo: 12-sided dodecagon rotating, each 96° angle lighting up
- Color palette: TBD (needs to work globally, appeal to creators and developers)
- Emoji potential: 9️⃣6️⃣

## THE PRODUCT: WHAT NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED

### The Platform Model

**Social Features (TikTok-like)**
- Follow creators/experts
- "For You" algorithmic feed of knowledge collections
- Trending collections this week
- Discovery by category (music, research, design, AI, etc.)
- Comments on specific versions/commits
- Upvote/like valuable collections
- Remix/fork culture (like TikTok duets, but for knowledge)

**Version Control Features (GitHub-like)**
- Full version history for every knowledge collection
- Branching and merging for collaborative work
- Fork any public collection
- Pull requests for contributions
- Commit history with annotations
- Diff views to see what changed between versions

**Creator Economy Features (Patreon-like)**
- Free tier: Unlimited public sharing
- Creator tier ($9/mo): Private collections, analytics, verified badge
- Pro tier ($29/mo): Sell premium content, API access, advanced collaboration
- Platform takes 30% on all premium content sales
- Direct support/tipping for creators
- Revenue analytics dashboard

**RAG Intelligence Features**
- Search across ALL public knowledge collections
- "People who used this research also used..."
- Semantic search powered by RAG under the hood
- Cross-pollination of ideas (DJ samples + AI prompts in same feed)
- RAG-powered Q&A on any public collection

### Target User Progression
1.1. **Phase 1: Developers** (RAG systems, AI prompts, technical docs)
1.2. **Phase 2: Creators** (DJs, designers, researchers, educators)
1.3. **Phase 3: Mainstream** (knowledge sharing for everyone)

### Technical Considerations (To Be Architected)
- **Domains:** ra96it.com and ra96it.app
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare (speed/scale/CDN)
- **Frontend:** Likely Next.js, mobile-first design
- **Backend:** Serverless architecture (TBD which cloud provider)
- **Storage:** Needs to handle large file collections, version histories
- **Search:** RAG implementation for intelligent retrieval

---

## BUSINESS MODEL

### Revenue Streams

**1. Freemium Subscriptions**
- Free: Public knowledge sharing, unlimited follows, discovery feed
- Creator ($9/mo): Private collections, analytics, verified badge, premium feed placement
- Pro ($29/mo): Team features, API access, advanced collaboration tools, sell premium content

**2. Platform Transaction Fees**
- 30% take rate on all premium content sales
- Similar to Apple App Store / Patreon model
- Creators keep 70%, platform takes 30%

**3. Future Opportunities (Post-MVP)**
- Sponsored collections (advertising)
- Promoted posts in discovery feed
- Enterprise white-label deployments
- API access for third-party integrations

### Unit Economics Assumptions (To Be Validated)
- Target: 10M users in Year 1, 100M users by Year 3
- Conversion to paid: 5-10% (industry standard for freemium)
- Average revenue per paid user: $15-30/month
- Creator marketplace transaction volume: TBD (depends on adoption)

### The Path to $100B
This is ambitious. Needs validation through:
- Market size analysis
- Competitive positioning
- Network effects modeling
- Creator economics research

---

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (From Past Research)

### Direct Competitors
**None found.** No existing "GitHub for RAG" platform currently exists.

### Adjacent Platforms
- **RAG Development Tools:** Galileo, Orq.ai, ChatBees (focused on developers, not creators)
- **Version Control:** GitHub (code only), Google Docs (limited versioning)
- **Creator Platforms:** Patreon (no versioning), Gumroad (simple digital sales)
- **Social Discovery:** TikTok (no version control), Medium (limited collaboration)

### The Opportunity
RAGGIT would be first-to-market in combining:
- Version control for non-code content
- Social discovery and algorithmic feeds
- Creator monetization at scale
- RAG-powered intelligent search

### Key Differentiation
- **Network effects:** More users = more knowledge = better RAG = more users
- **Data moat:** Building world's largest versioned knowledge graph
- **Creator focus:** Not just developers, but ALL knowledge creators
- **Movement branding:** "We are the 96%" creates cultural differentiation

## KEY QUESTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE TO HELP ANSWER

These are the big strategic questions that need resolution before building:

### Product Strategy
1. Should MVP focus on developers first, or try to appeal to creators from day 1?
2. What's the minimum viable feature set to prove the concept?
3. How do we balance social features vs technical features in v1?
4. What's the "killer feature" that drives initial adoption?

### Technical Architecture
5. How do we implement version control for arbitrary content types (not just code)?
6. What's the RAG implementation strategy? (Build vs buy vs integrate)
7. How do we handle storage at scale for large creator files?
8. What's the right database architecture for social + versioned content?

### User Experience
9. How do non-technical users understand "version control"?
10. What does a "knowledge collection" look like to an end user?
11. How does discovery/search work across such diverse content types?
12. What makes someone want to "fork" knowledge vs just bookmark it?

### Business Model
13. How do we validate the 30% take rate is acceptable to creators?
14. What prevents creators from just using payment links outside the platform?
15. How do we cold-start the marketplace (chicken and egg problem)?
16. What's the path from 0 to 10,000 paying creators?

### Movement & Brand
17. How do we communicate "We are the 96%" without seeming political?
18. Does the No Billionaires Clause need to be public from day 1?
19. How do we make "96" feel like a movement, not just a number?
20. What's the relationship between RAGGIT (product name) and 96 (movement)?

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

By the end of your work with Claude Code, we should have:

1. **A comprehensive document** (or set of documents) that any developer could pick up and understand exactly what to build

2. **Visual representations** of the product (wireframes, architecture diagrams, ERDs)

3. **Clear prioritization** of what's MVP vs what's future roadmap

4. **Validated assumptions** (or at least, documented assumptions that need testing)

5. **A roadmap** for going from nothing to launched MVP to scaled platform

6. **Answers to hard questions** about product, tech, and business model

7. **Excitement and clarity** about what we're building and why it matters

---

## CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS

### What Claude Code Should NOT Do
- Don't write production code yet (this is design phase)
- Don't make technology choices without presenting trade-offs
- Don't ignore the "We are the 96%" movement aspect (it's core to brand)
- Don't oversimplify the complexity (version control for arbitrary content is HARD)
- Don't assume users understand RAG, versioning, or technical concepts

### What Claude Code SHOULD Do
- Ask probing questions to uncover edge cases
- Challenge assumptions that don't make sense
- Propose multiple options with pros/cons for big decisions
- Think about both developer users AND creator users
- Consider global audience (not just US-centric)
- Remember this is a SOCIAL platform, not just a tool
- Keep the $100B vision in mind (think big, start focused)

---

## RESEARCH & CONTEXT GATHERING

Before making recommendations, Claude Code should research:

### Market Research
- Existing creator economy platforms (revenue models, take rates)
- Version control UX patterns (how GitHub explains git to newcomers)
- Social discovery algorithms (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter)
- RAG implementation best practices (which vendors, which approaches)

### User Research (Hypothetical)
- Developer personas (what do RAG developers need?)
- Creator personas (what do DJs, designers, educators need?)
- Job-to-be-done framework (what are users hiring RAGGIT to do?)

### Technical Research
- Serverless architecture patterns for social platforms
- Database choices for versioned content at scale
- CDN strategies for global content delivery
- RAG vector database options

### Competitive Research
- Deep dive on GitHub (what made it successful?)
- Deep dive on Patreon (how do they monetize creators?)
- Deep dive on TikTok (how does their discovery algorithm work?)
- Analysis of failed platforms in adjacent spaces

---

## COMMUNICATION STYLE FOR DELIVERABLES

When creating documentation, Claude Code should:

1. **Be visual where possible** - Diagrams > text walls
2. **Use examples liberally** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Present options** - "Here are 3 approaches to solve X, with trade-offs"
4. **Be opinionated but flexible** - Make recommendations, but explain reasoning
5. **Think in systems** - How do decisions cascade and affect other areas?
6. **Write for multiple audiences** - Developers AND non-technical stakeholders
7. **Keep the vision alive** - Don't lose sight of the movement and $100B goal

---

## FINAL NOTES

**This is not a typical "build this feature" project.** This is early-stage product design where we're figuring out what to build and how to build it.

**You have permission to:**
- Disagree with stated assumptions
- Identify gaps in the thinking
- Propose alternative approaches
- Ask "why" repeatedly
- Challenge the business model
- Suggest pivots if something doesn't make sense

**Your job is to:**
- Help me think more clearly about what RAGGIT should be
- Identify the hard problems early
- Propose thoughtful solutions with trade-offs
- Document everything so we can build with confidence
- Get me ready to actually start coding with Claude Code

**This is a creative, collaborative design process. Let's figure this out together.**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Read this entire document thoroughly
2. Review all past conversations in this Claude.ai project (use conversation_search and recent_chats)
3. Identify the 5-10 biggest open questions
4. Propose a work plan for how to tackle the deliverables
5. Start asking me questions to clarify the vision
6. Begin creating the specification documents

**Let's build something the 96% actually wants.** 🔥
