# Collaborating with AI Assistants through a Human Intermediary

When collaborating with AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude.ai through a human intermediary, it's essential to understand the unique dynamics and constraints of this interaction mode. Here are some key considerations and best practices:

1. **Asynchronous Communication**: Collaboration happens asynchronously, with the human intermediary facilitating the exchange of information and instructions between the AI assistant and other stakeholders. Be prepared for delays in response times and plan accordingly.

2. **Limited Context Visibility**: AI assistants have access only to the information and instructions provided by the human intermediary. They lack direct visibility into the work of other agents or the overall project status. Keep this in mind when framing requests and providing context.

3. **Clear and Specific Instructions**: Provide clear, detailed, and specific instructions to the AI assistant through the human intermediary. Break down complex tasks into smaller, well-defined steps to ensure accurate understanding and execution.

4. **Incremental Progress Updates**: Request regular progress updates from the AI assistant to stay informed about their work, challenges encountered, and next steps. This helps maintain transparency and enables timely intervention if needed.

5. **Explicit Context Sharing**: When relevant, include necessary context, background information, or references alongside instructions to help the AI assistant understand the bigger picture and deliver more accurate and comprehensive responses.

6. **Iterative Refinement**: Collaboration through a human intermediary often involves multiple rounds of feedback and refinement. Be prepared to review the AI assistant's outputs, provide constructive feedback, and iterate until the desired results are achieved.

7. **File-based Collaboration**: Establish clear file naming conventions and formats for exchanging information, instructions, and deliverables between the AI assistant and the human intermediary. This ensures smooth and organized collaboration.

8. **Patience and Clarity**: Working through a human intermediary may introduce additional communication layers and potential misunderstandings. Exercise patience, provide clear and unambiguous instructions, and be open to clarifying any doubts or questions that arise.

9. **Realistic Expectations**: Understand the capabilities and limitations of the AI assistant based on the information they have been provided. Set realistic expectations and avoid assuming knowledge or context that hasn't been explicitly shared.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Foster a culture of continuous improvement by encouraging the AI assistant to proactively seek clarification, provide suggestions, and share insights based on their understanding of the project and their own capabilities.

By keeping these considerations in mind and adapting the collaboration approach accordingly, you can effectively leverage the capabilities of AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude.ai, even when working through a human intermediary. Clear communication, explicit context sharing, and iterative refinement are key to achieving successful outcomes in this unique collaboration model.
