# Code Talker Recognition Proposal Query

The DEIA project team is considering implementing a recognition system for code talkers who contribute to the project. The proposed system aims to foster a fair and motivating environment that encourages active participation, high-quality work, and continuous improvement. The key components of the proposed recognition system are as follows:

## Recognition Categories
1. **Code Contributions**: Recognizing code talkers for delivering high-quality, well-documented, and maintainable code that adheres to project guidelines and best practices.
2. **Collaboration and Communication**: Acknowledging code talkers who actively participate in discussions, provide helpful feedback, and maintain clear and professional communication with team members.
3. **Problem Solving**: Rewarding code talkers who demonstrate exceptional problem-solving skills, propose innovative solutions, and effectively address complex challenges.
4. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**: Appreciating code talkers who create comprehensive documentation, share knowledge, and help onboard new team members.
5. **Adherence to Guidelines**: Recognizing code talkers who consistently follow project instructions, adhere to specified formats, and maintain a high level of compliance with project standards.

## Recognition Mechanisms
1. **Contribution Tokens**: Implementing a token-based system where code talkers earn tokens for their contributions in each recognition category. Tokens can be redeemed for rewards or privileges within the project ecosystem.
2. **Leaderboard**: Maintaining a leaderboard that displays the top contributors based on their earned tokens, fostering a sense of friendly competition and motivation.
3. **Badges and Titles**: Awarding digital badges or titles to code talkers who reach certain milestones or demonstrate exceptional performance in specific categories.
4. **Spotlight Features**: Regularly showcasing outstanding contributions, success stories, or innovative solutions by code talkers in project newsletters, blog posts, or team meetings.
5. **Peer Recognition**: Encouraging code talkers to nominate and vote for their peers who have made significant contributions or demonstrated exemplary behavior.

## Token Distribution
- **Code Contributions**: 1-5 tokens per accepted pull request, based on complexity and impact.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: 1-3 tokens for helpful feedback, active participation in discussions, or resolving communication challenges.
- **Problem Solving**: 2-5 tokens for proposing innovative solutions or effectively tackling complex issues.
